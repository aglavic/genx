Changes 3.7.5
=============
 * Update the windows build environment
 * Update windows installer to remove previous version, avoiding conflicts
 * GenX installed via pip can now be executed as "python -m genx"
 * Fix SLD plot in mag_refl interpreting slicing option wrongly (#206)

Changes 3.7.4
=============
 * Fix bugs that could lead to unexpected results or errors when selecting polarization states.
 * Replace deprecated appdirs by platformdirs module.
 * Make genx_server run without numba (now numba has to be manually installed if it is desired).
 * Fix some minor issues with code and warnings during testing.

Changes 3.7.3
=============
 * Add possibility of longitudinal scans to off-specular simulation (interdiff)
 * Add detector resolution and off-specular scaling factor to interdiff model, absolut scaling needs correction

Changes 3.7.2
=============
 * Fixes for compatibility with Python 3.13
 * Fix to issue that might occur in some testing environments

Changes 3.7.1
=============
 * Fix incompatibility with Python 3.12 dataclasses.

Changes 3.7.0
=============
 * Add the FrequencyAnalysis plugin that allows to analyze the reflectivity using various corrections to
   extract approximate layer thicknesses.
 * Add advanced footprint and resolution classes that can even be replaced by user defined functions. See
   the trapezoidal beam profile example in "SuperAdam_SiO_advanced_fp_res.hgx".
 * Add Zeeman-effect correction for neutron polarization analysis with spin-flip in elevated external field
   to the spec_adaptive model. Can be activated using the instrument parameter "zeeman" and "mag_field".
 * Model help button in all parameter dialogs to quickly look up the meaning of parameters. 
 * Implement new python dataclass based model parameterization. The GUI will detect any parameter in the model
   based on the base class which allows more flexibility in model modification and improves general maintainability.
 * Add code signature to Mac OS distribution to remove need for user to ignore security warnings on installation/run.
   The distribution now uses package installers ".pkg" instead of ".dmg", no more warnings should occure for first start.
   (Thanks to the international scattering alliance for support in creating the certificate.)
 * Add feature to invert sample structure for measurements from two sides of the surface. To use
   set in the script "sample = -sample". If you use both in one model, don't forget to invert back after
   the simulation in question.
 * Change parameteriazation of interdiff model to use sigma+sigmar instead of sigmai+sigmar to make it
   equivalent to reflectivity models that only use sigma = sqrt(sigmai**2+sigmar**2). To fit sigmai one
   should create a user parameter or set proper limits in sigma+sigmar fit.
 * Increase test coverage, especially for code inside of models. This lead to several bug fixes and
   will improve stability of future releases.

 * The model mag_refl can now:
   - Simulate energy scans.
   - Simulate "normal" x-ray reflectivity.
   - Simulate scans with polarisation analysis.
   - Use negative values of mag.
 * spec_nx and mag_refl can now simulate the asymmetry signal in neutron reflectivity.
 * Refactoring of the Reflectivity base models.
 * Numerous reported bugs fixed. (See http://sourceforge.net/p/genx/code/commit_browser
   for detailed changes).
