    Fixed long standing issue with the speed display in when using
    parallel processing.
    Added help on the FOM functions.

2009-03-29:
    Fixed yet another bug in plotpanel relating to the new version of
    matplotlib.
    Fixed a bug in the search replace:
    no scrolling when searching the scriptbug, ID: 2720666
    Fixed bug in the refelctivity plugin:
    Bug in adding a layer with substrate marked, ID: 2633020 
    Fixed bug in the refelctivity plugin:
    ID: 2720662, Plugin does not check if the names are valid
    Fixed bug with no limit on the number of logged fom evaluations
    ID: 2681825, Memory error during fitting
    This was fixed by adding a new class CircBuff in the diffev module.
    It has a maximum length of the buffer before it starts to overwrite
    the oldest value (FIFO). A new parameter in genx.conf "max log elements"
    has been introduced.
    Added the possiblity to change the names of the Layer and stacks in the
    reflectivity plugin.
    ID:2720837, change the Layer/Stack name
    
    
2009-03-10:
    Changed plotpanel. Problems under newer versions of matplotlib

2009-02-12:
    Chaged utils a bit so that it can safely be imported with a *

2009-01-14: GenX 2b5.1
2008-12-11:
    Found a bug in the tof measurements for neutrons sigma and d had needed
    some truncation in order to get them working. Fixed.
    
2008-12-10:
    Fixed a bug that occured in my bugfix in the Reflectivty plugin from 
    2008-11-21, spotted by Gunnar. 
    Fixed bug in the optimizer saving routines, appeared only on windows and 
    mac...

2008-11-30:
    Changes to the Reflectivty plugin. It now tries to load an existing model
    when the plugin is loaded.
    The loaded plugins is also saved as the model is saved and are tried to
    be loded when the model loaded again. Also it is possible to define 
    default plugins in genx.conf.
    Found a bug in reflectivity plugin:
    The parameter section got many: "p = UserVars()" upon saving. Fixed

2008-11-28:
    Fixed the Key error given when shutting GenX down. Due to that the pool
    of workers where living in a thread. When removed from that thread the
    error disappeared.
    Added alot of error checking for loading and saving files. Should be almost
    idiot proof now.

2008-11-27:
    Added Ibkg to the interdiff model (not implemented previously)
    Added revival of the FOM vs generations plot after loading of data.
    Fixed bugs in the insertion of the layers.

2008-11-26:
    Added documentation to the plugins.
    Added documentation to the data loaders.
    Fixed export scritp+export table bug. When asked to overwrite the file
    the program asks about the gx file.
    Implemented autosaving every X generation. If wanted by the user, default
     off.
    Also added also atosave, errobar level, parallel processeing alternatives
    to the optimizer settings dialog box.
    
2008-11-23:
    Added procssing as an package in the about box. 
    Added code so that the fit state also is saved to the model. 

2008-11-22: 
    Solved the problem with the convolute fast. All three methods
    give very similair results. However it is dependent on step size
    integration range etc.
    Added the possiblity to work with g/cm^3 as the density. Implemented
    a new scattering database for x-rays and neutrons fw, bw that makes
    this possible. Not tested yet.
    Added help frames for data loaders and plugins as well. The documentation
    still to be written.

2008-11-21:
    Fixed bug in exporting data sets to a dat file. Now it is a 
    data set 3 digits wide with zeros!. Also if an extension is added
    it will not overwrite it. Also added an header with the time that the
    data was exported - can be handy.
    Fixed the normalization problem that Gunnar found for reflectivity 
    measurements. Fixed it up and did a nice normalization of the 
    weight function in /lib/instrument.py. However Convolute fast with
    varying resolution does not work.

2008-11-20:
    Implemented parallel processing for the model calculation
    with the help of the processing package. Tested and seems to work
    under Linux. However I only see a about 50% speed increase could it 
    be that I have some over head?

2008-11-08:
    Found and corrected a bug in reflectivity, the tabbing of the data
    sets was not compatible with the editor.

2008-11-07: 
    Added errorbar level to the configuration file. It is now possible
    to change the default value.
    Fixed the reset problem of parameters when scanning them.
    Added a point for the current paraemtervalue in the fomscan plot.
    Also added a horizontal line for increase of the fom that determines 
    the errorbars.

2008-11-03: 
    Added and sucessfully tested a new plugin UserFuncs to GenX.
    This allow the user to run custom functions defined in the script.
    Fixed a bug that the program wont close when a saved model is in 
    active...
    Fixed the bug with the boolean flag when importing a table with fit
    parameters into GenX
===============================================================================
2008-11-03: GenX2.0b4 released
2008-11-02:
    Tested and corrected bugs for the commands on the extra data. This is
    now fully implemented and working.
    Fixed plotting of FOM and Pars. Autoscale flag had no effect on the
    updating. Fixed and tested.
    Added a question if the model is not saved when exiting the program.
    Added also scaling to linear autoscaling 5%. Just makes linear plots look
    a bit nicer.
    Implemented a new parameter in the model interdiff.py, taylor_n so that 
    the number of terms in the taylor expansion can be controlled.

2008-10-30:
    Implemented additional commands for extra data. Have only tested that the
    the function remains with original data. Full testing remains to be done.
    Also fixed an error handling bug in data_loader/default.py and sls_sxrd.py
    
2008-10-28:
    Added question for save as if an existing file is overwritten.
    This was also done for export script and export table.
    Have previously fixed some serious bugs in the structurefactor part.
    And also found and corrected bugs in the table export/import function.

2008-09-14:
    Fixed bug in the printing and copying of the plots. Could only print
    or copy the first plot.
    Implemented scatttering lengths plots in the reflectivity plugin.
    
2008-09-13:
    Made modification so the user can see wheter or not any changes has been
    made since the last saving of the model. This is displayed by a little
    star after teh filename

2008-09-12:
    Fixed a bug reported by Gunnar needed resolution to have footprint
    correction.
    Added background as a paraemter to interdiff and spec_nx
    Fixed a bug found by Gunnar in the reflectivty module: The module did
    not handle layers correctly (order changed in the stacks)
    Fixed a new bug found by me: The new implementation of proxy objects did
    not work with the custom dialog module used in the reflectivity module.

2008-09-09:
    Implemented some more help on the modules with my help scheme, 
    html docstrings. 
    IMplemented the either or algorithm in DiffEv both with random
    base vector as well as the best vector as base. Tested and works
    
2008-09-08:
    Fixed the scattering factor database acess to automagically update
    the values when changing the database references.
    
2008-09-07:
    Added colourized html text to the Refelctvity plugin.
    Added tooltips to reflectivity plugin and data panel.
    Added a frame to display doc strings html formatted from the
    different modules in the models directory.
===============================================================================
2008-09-05: GenX2.0b2 released
2008-09-05:
    Hopefully fixed problem with negative numbers and errorbars in
    the plotpanel module. 
    Made everything that is in the script saved. (before only the simulated
    part was saved)
    
2008-09-04:
    Added bc as a database in models.utils. The coherent neutron scattering 
    lengths as given in Neutron News. 
    Made some small changes to plotpanel to resolves 0 problems when plotting.
    Updated the homepage with the first tutorial.

2008-09-03:
    Implemented Quit callback.
    Fixed link for the homepage in the About box. One slash was missing
    Added the R-factor as one of the possible FOM's
     that is R1 and R2
    Fixed a bug under windows, the lineending gave an error
    upon compiling. No the compile function splits all the lines and
    adds a proper lineending to them.
    Found a  bug in the loading of plugin - A new plugin could not be loaded
    since I had overwritten that variable name with the previous plugins name,
     fixed.
    Added a show status text function to the datalist and data loader plugin
    Tested extra_data in the DataSet class. 
    Added spec_nx to the models. Tested at looks as it works!
    
2008-09-01:
    Problem with that all does not exist in the standard library for 
    python versions < 2.5. Removed all all statements.
    Bugfix, the data table (view folder) was not completely cleared due to
    misuse of DeleteRows method.

2008-08-31:
    Fixed problem with that the grid resetted, moved to the beginning of the
    grid, during update when fitting.
    Removed some print statements to silence the program.
    Added a red background to the parameter that are out of bounds.
    Added the possiblity to change the mutation scheme method.
    Added the possiblity to do unconstrained fitting.
    Fixed a couple of bugs in Reflectivity (empty print statements)
    which caused the plugin to fail loading.
    Found a bug in Reflectivity, could not load more than one stack - 
    otherwise the order got screwed up. Fixed it. 
    Made so that the Reflectivity module actually loads the expressions
    rather than the values in the sample. This makes it possible to
    store expressions.
