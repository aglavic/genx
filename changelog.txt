    Fixed a couple of bugs in Reflectivity (empty print statements)
    which caused the plugin to fail loading.
    Found a bug in Reflectivity, could not load more than one stack - 
    otherwise the order got screwed up. Fixed it. 
    Made so that the Reflectivity module actually loads the expressions
    rather than the values in the sample. This makes it possible to
    store expressions.
