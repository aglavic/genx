    Fixed problem with that the grid resetted, moved to the beginning of the
    grid, during update when fitting.
    Removed some print statements to silence the program.
    Added a red background to the parameter that are out of bounds.
    Added the possiblity to change the mutation scheme method.
    Added the possiblity to do unconstrained fitting.
    Fixed a couple of bugs in Reflectivity (empty print statements)
    which caused the plugin to fail loading.
    Found a bug in Reflectivity, could not load more than one stack - 
    otherwise the order got screwed up. Fixed it. 
    Made so that the Reflectivity module actually loads the expressions
    rather than the values in the sample. This makes it possible to
    store expressions.
