    Added the R-factor as one of the possible FOM's
     that is R1 and R2
    Fixed a bug under windows, the lineending gave an error

    adds a proper lineending to them.

     fixed.

    Added the possiblity to change the mutation scheme method.
    Added the possiblity to do unconstrained fitting.
    Fixed a couple of bugs in Reflectivity (empty print statements)
    which caused the plugin to fail loading.
    Found a bug in Reflectivity, could not load more than one stack - 
    otherwise the order got screwed up. Fixed it. 
    Made so that the Reflectivity module actually loads the expressions
    rather than the values in the sample. This makes it possible to
    store expressions.
