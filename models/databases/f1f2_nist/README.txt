These tables were generated Wed Jun  4 23:16:50 2014.
The following files were created by the download_nist.py script located in the GenX distribution. The data
were generated from the NIST X-ray Form Factor, Attenuation and Scattering Tables (FFAST) located at:
http://www.nist.gov/pml/data/ffast/index.cfm.

Each element's scattering factors were evaluated according to eq. 4 in
C. T. Chandler J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 29(4) 597-1048 (2000). Thus the scattering factors were calculated
according to
    f1 = f_1 + f_rel(3/5 CL) + f_NT,
    f2 = f_2.

According to the homepage, see above, the tables should be referenced according to:
